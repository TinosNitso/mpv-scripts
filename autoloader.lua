----AUTO-LOADER FOR OTHER SCRIPTS (IF THEY AREN'T ALREADY LOADED). MAY ALSO SET CONFIG OPTIONS. PUT ALL SCRIPTS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THIS, & LIST THEIR NAMES HERE. TOGGLE THEM ON/OFF WITH TYPOS (THEY ALSO COME WITH DOUBLE-mute TOGGLES).
----INSTEAD OF ALL SCRIPTS LAUNCHING EACH OTHER WITH THE SAME CODE, THIS SCRIPT LAUNCHES THEM ALL. THEY ARE ALL ~200 LINES, WITH MANY PARTS COPY/PASTED FROM EACH OTHER.
----IN SMPLAYER'S ADVANCED mpv PREFERENCES ENTER  --script=autoloader.lua  (WINDOWS smplayer.exe FOLDER).   MACOS: --script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua     LINUX: --script=/home/user/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua  

options={ --ALL OPTIONAL & CAN BE REMOVED.
    scripts={
             "aspeed.lua",     --CLOCK, TITLE & AUDIO DEVICES SPEED RANDOMIZATION, FOR UP TO 10 HOURS. INSTA-TOGGLE. CONVERTS MONO TO (RANDOMIZED) SURROUND SOUND. MY FAVOURITE OVERALL. CONVERTS A SPEAKER INTO A METAPHORICAL MOCKING-BIRD.
             "autocomplex.lua",--ANIMATED AUDIO SPECTRUM, VOLUME BARS, FPS LIMITER. DUAL lavfi-complex OVERLAY. SLOW TOGGLE (INTERRUPTS PLAYBACK).
             "autocrop.lua",   --CROP OFF BLACK BARS BEFORE MASK, BUT AFTER SPECTRAL OVERLAY. INSTA-TOGGLE. autocrop-smooth.lua FOR SMOOTH VERSION (TOO MUCH CPU WHEN COMBINED).
             "automask.lua",   --ANIMATED FILTERS (MOVING LENSES, ETC). INSTA-TOGGLE. LENS FORMULA ADDS GLOW TO DARKNESS. 
            },
    
    loop_limit=10,  --SECONDS (MAX). INFINITE loop GIF & SHORT MP4 (IN SMPLAYER TOO). STOPS MPV SNAPPING. ALL MY SCRIPTS NEED IT, SO IT FITS IN WITH autoloader.    BASED ON https://github.com/zc62/mpv-scripts/blob/master/autoloop.lua
    config ={
             'osd-duration 5000','osd-bar no',  --DEFAULTS 1000,yes  (MILLISECONDS,BOOL)  TAKES TIME TO READ osd. SMPLAYER ALREADY HAS A seek BAR.

            mp.commandv('load-script', utils.join_path(directory,script)) end end end    --commandv FOR FILENAMES.     CONCEPT IS TO split_path FROM WHATEVER THE USER TYPED IN, & THEN join_path TO ALL OTHER scripts.

----A FUTURE VERSION SHOULD BE ABLE TO STREAM-DUMP ALL YOUTUBE VIDEOS IN AUTO - A RECYCLE BIN FOR STREAMING.
----ALL SCRIPTS TESTED IN WIN10, LINUX (DEBIAN-MATE) & MACOS-CATALINA, USING MPV v0.36 (INCL. v3) & v0.35. TESTED SMPLAYER RELEASES .7z .exe .dmg .AppImage .flatpak .snap  ALL SCRIPTS NOW PASS snap INSPECTION.
----"autoload.lua" NAME IS ALREADY TAKEN BY A PLAYLIST SCRIPT WHICH LOADS ALL VIDEO FILES IN FOLDER. autoloader MAY LOAD SCRIPTS INSTEAD.
----SMPLAYER ACTIONS  aspect_none reset_zoom  CAN START EACH FILE (ADVANCED PREFERENCES). IT MAY CONTROL FINAL GPU WINDOW. MOUSE WHEEL FUNCTION CAN BE SWITCHED FROM seek TO zoom. seek WITH GRAPHS IS TOO SLOW (FULL automask REGEN), BUT zoom INSTANT. FINAL video-zoom CONTROLLED BY SMPLAYERâ†’GPU.
----TOTAL CPU USAGE UNDER 50%. UNLIKE A PLUGIN THE ONLY BINARY IS MPV ITSELF, & SCRIPTS COMMAND IT. EACH SCRIPT PREPS & CONTROLS A SINGLE GRAPH OF ffmpeg-filters. MOVING MASK, SPECTRUM, audio RANDOMIZATION & CROPS ARE NOTHING BUT MPV COMMANDS. HOWEVER THE FEWER COMMANDS THE BETTER - ALMOST ALL TIME DEPENDENCE IS BAKED INTO GRAPH FILTERS. 
----DECLARING local VARIABLES HELPS WITH HIGHLIGHTING, BUT UNNECESSARY. NOTEPAD++ HAS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS FOR LINE DUPLICATION, DELETION & COMMENTARY TOGGLES, FOR RAPID GRAPH TESTING, + MULTI-LINE EDITING. MPV HAS LUA, LIKE HOW NOTEPAD++ HAS SCINTILLA, GIMP HAS SCM (SCHEME), SCIENCE HAS PYTHON, PDF HAS LATEX, MATH HAS OCTAVE/MATLAB, STATS HAS R, WEB HAS JAVASCRIPT/HTML, & WINDOWS HAS AUTOHOTKEY (AHK), ETC.  AHK CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING WITH A 1MB .exe, WITH 1 SECOND BUILD TIME.   

----LINUX BUILDS ADD MORE VARIETY, DEPENDING ON deb, AppImage, flatpak, snap & rpm. SO video SCRIPTING FOR LINUX CAN BE TRICKY, BECAUSE IDEALLY SCRIPTS SHOULD WORK WITH ALL POSSIBLE BUILDS.
----sudo apt install smplayer flatpak mpv snapd      FOR RELEVANT LINUX INSTALLS. OFFLINE LINUX ALL-IN-ONE: SMPlayer-23.6.0-x86_64.AppImage
----https://smplayer.info/en/download-linux & https://apt.fruit.je/ubuntu/jammy/mpv/ FOR LINUX SMPLAYER & MPV.
----flatpak run info.smplayer.SMPlayer      snap run smplayer       FOR LINUX TESTING.
----sudo snap install *.snap  TO OFFLINE-INSTALL smplayer*.snap     BUT IT WON'T WORK WITH "~/", NOR SOME FILTERS THE EXACT SAME WAY, LIKE shuffleplanes,negate=y,scale=flags:eval. IT ALSO BLOCKS SYSTEM COMMANDS.
