----AUTO-LOADER FOR OTHER SCRIPTS (IF THEY AREN'T ALREADY LOADED). MAY ALSO SET CONFIG OPTIONS. PUT ALL SCRIPTS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THIS, & LIST THEM HERE. TOGGLE THEM ON/OFF WITH TYPOS (THEY ALSO COME WITH DOUBLE-mute TOGGLES).
----INSTEAD OF ALL SCRIPTS LAUNCHING EACH OTHER WITH THE SAME CODE, THIS SCRIPT LAUNCHES THEM ALL. THEY ARE ALL ~200 LINES LONG, WITH MANY PARTS COPY/PASTED FROM EACH OTHER.
----IN SMPLAYER'S ADVANCED mpv PREFERENCES ENTER  --script=autoloader.lua  (WINDOWS smplayer.exe FOLDER).   MACOS: --script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua     LINUX: --script=/home/user/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua  

options={ --ALL OPTIONAL & CAN BE REMOVED.
    scripts={"aspeed.lua",      --CLOCK, TITLE & AUDIO DEVICES SPEED RANDOMIZATION FOR 10 HOURS. CONVERTS MONO TO (RANDOMIZED) SURROUND SOUND. MY FAVOURITE OVERALL.
             "autocrop.lua",    --CROPS BLACK BARS BEFORE MASK, BUT AFTER SPECTRAL OVERLAY.     ON LINUX DON'T USE snap (BREAKS FRAME-BY-FRAME SCALING).
             "autocomplex.lua", --ANIMATED AUDIO SPECTRUM, VOLUME BARS, FPS LIMITER. LAVFI-COMPLEX OVERLAY.
             "automask.lua",    --ANIMATED FILTERS (MOVING BINOCULARS, ETC). LENS FORMULA MAY NEGATE BRIGHTNESS.
            },
    
    loop_limit=10,  --SECONDS (MAX). INFINITE loop GIF & SHORT MP4 (IN SMPLAYER TOO). STOPS MPV SNAPPING. ALL MY SCRIPTS NEED IT, SO IT FITS IN WITH autoloader.    BASED ON autoloop.lua.
    config ={
             'osd-duration 5000','osd-bar no',  --DEFAULTS 1000,yes  (MILLISECONDS,BOOL)  TAKES TIME TO READ osd, BUT bar GETS IN THE WAY.
             -- 'ytdl no','osc  no',            --DISABLE DEFAULT YOUTUBE-DOWNLOAD,ON-SCREEN-CONTROLLER SCRIPTS?

o,utils = options,require 'mp.utils' --ABBREV.
if o.config then for _,option in pairs(o.config) do mp.command('no-osd set '..option) end end  --APPLY config BEFORE scripts.

directory=utils.split_path(mp.get_property('scripts'))    --split FROM WHATEVER THE USER ENTERED.   ALTERNATIVE mp.get_script_directory() HAS BUG.
if o.scripts then for _,script in pairs(o.scripts) do is_present,CscriptC,scripts = false,'"'..script..'"',mp.get_property('scripts')  --CscriptC="script" ("'" & "," MAY BE IN FILENAMES). TRY LOAD ALL scripts IF NOT ALREADY LOADED (is_present).
        SCRIPTSU,SCRIPTU = scripts:upper(),script:upper()    --SEARCH NOT CASE SENSITIVE. CHECK IF ALREADY LAUNCHED.
        for _,find in pairs({ CscriptC:upper() , SCRIPTU..',' , ','..SCRIPTU }) --EITHER '"script"' OR 'script,' OR ',script' MAY BE ANNOUNCED.     BUG: CODE TRIGGERS ON TYPO @FINAL SCRIPT.
        do if SCRIPTSU:find(find,1,true) then is_present=true   -- 1,true = STARTING-INDEX,EXACT-MATCH  
            break end end    
        if not is_present then mp.set_property('scripts',scripts..','..CscriptC)   -- ANNOUNCE NEW script, AFTER CHECKING CURRENT LIST.
             mp.commandv('load-script', utils.join_path(directory,script)) end end end    --commandv FOR FILENAMES.     THE IDEA IS TO split_path FROM WHATEVER THE USER TYPED IN, & THEN join_path TO ALL OTHER scripts.

----ALL SCRIPTS TESTED IN WIN10, LINUX (DEBIAN-MATE) & MACOS-CATALINA, USING MPV v0.36 (INCL. v3) & v0.35     TESTED SMPLAYER .7z .exe .dmg .flatpak .AppImage  RELEASES
----SMPLAYER ACTIONS  aspect_none reset_zoom  CAN START EACH FILE (ADVANCED PREFERENCES). IT MAY CONTROL FINAL GPU WINDOW. MOUSE WHEEL FUNCTION CAN BE SWITCHED FROM seek TO zoom. seeking WITH GRAPHS IS TOO SLOW, BUT zoom INSTANT. FINAL video-zoom CONTROLLED BY SMPLAYERâ†’GPU.
----EVEN WITH ALL SCRIPTS ACTIVE I CONSIDER PLAYBACK ON A PAR WITH VLC, DEPENDING ON VIDEO.
----UNLIKE A PLUGIN THE ONLY BINARY IS MPV ITSELF, & SCRIPTS COMMAND IT. EACH SCRIPT PREPS & CONTROLS GRAPH/S OF ffmpeg-filters. MOVING MASK, SPECTRUM, audio RANDOMIZATION & CROPS ARE NOTHING BUT MPV COMMANDS. HOWEVER THE FEWER COMMANDS THE BETTER - ALMOST ALL TIME DEPENDENCE IS BAKED INTO GRAPH FILTERS. 
----MPV HAS LUA, LIKE HOW GIMP HAS SCM (SCHEME), NOTEPAD++ HAS SCINTILLA, SCIENCE HAS PYTHON/LATEX, MATH HAS OCTAVE/MATLAB, STATS HAS R, WEB HAS JAVASCRIPT/HTML, & WINDOWS HAS AUTOHOTKEY (AHK), ETC.  AHK CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING WITH A 1MB .exe, BUILT IN 1 SECOND.

----LINUX BUILDS ADD MORE VARIETY, DEPENDING ON deb, AppImage, flatpak, snap & rpm. SO video SCRIPTING FOR LINUX CAN BE TRICKY, BECAUSE IDEALLY SCRIPTS SHOULD WORK WITH ALL POSSIBLE BUILDS.
----sudo apt install smplayer flatpak mpv snapd      FOR RELEVANT LINUX INSTALLS. OFFLINE LINUX ALL-IN-ONE: SMPlayer-23.6.0-x86_64.AppImage
----https://smplayer.info/en/download-linux & https://apt.fruit.je/ubuntu/jammy/mpv/ FOR LINUX SMPLAYER & MPV.
----flatpak run info.smplayer.SMPlayer      snap run smplayer       FOR LINUX TESTING.
----sudo snap install *.snap  TO OFFLINE-INSTALL smplayer*.snap     BUT IT WON'T WORK WITH autocrop, "~/", NOR SOME FILTERS THE EXACT SAME WAY, LIKE shuffleplanes,negate=y,scale=flags:eval. IT ALSO BLOCKS SYSTEM COMMANDS.
