----AUTO-LOADER FOR OTHER SCRIPTS (IF THEY AREN'T ALREADY LOADED). MAY ALSO SET CONFIG OPTIONS. PUT ALL SCRIPTS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THIS, & LIST THEIR NAMES HERE. TOGGLE THEM ON/OFF WITH TYPOS (THEY ALSO COME WITH DOUBLE-mute TOGGLES).
----INSTEAD OF ALL SCRIPTS LAUNCHING EACH OTHER WITH THE SAME CODE, THIS SCRIPT LAUNCHES THEM ALL. THEY ARE ALL ~200 LINES LONG, WITH MANY PARTS COPY/PASTED FROM EACH OTHER.
----IN SMPLAYER'S ADVANCED mpv PREFERENCES ENTER  --script=autoloader.lua  (WINDOWS smplayer.exe FOLDER).   MACOS: --script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua     LINUX: --script=/home/user/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua  

options={ --ALL OPTIONAL & CAN BE REMOVED.
    scripts={"aspeed.lua",      --CLOCK, TITLE & AUDIO DEVICES SPEED RANDOMIZATION FOR 10 HOURS. CONVERTS MONO TO (RANDOMIZED) SURROUND SOUND. INSTA-TOGGLE. MY FAVOURITE OVERALL.
             "autocrop.lua",    --CROPS BLACK BARS BEFORE MASK, BUT AFTER SPECTRAL OVERLAY. INSTA-TOGGLE.     ON LINUX DON'T USE snap (BREAKS FRAME-BY-FRAME SCALING).
             "autocomplex.lua", --ANIMATED AUDIO SPECTRUM, VOLUME BARS, FPS LIMITER. DUAL LAVFI-COMPLEX OVERLAY. SLOW TOGGLE.
             "automask.lua",    --ANIMATED FILTERS (MOVING BINOCULARS, ETC). LENS FORMULA MAY NEGATE BRIGHTNESS. INSTA-TOGGLE. 
            },
    
    loop_limit=10,  --SECONDS (MAX). INFINITE loop GIF & SHORT MP4 (IN SMPLAYER TOO). STOPS MPV SNAPPING. ALL MY SCRIPTS NEED IT, SO IT FITS IN WITH autoloader.    BASED ON https://github.com/zc62/mpv-scripts/blob/master/autoloop.lua
    config ={

----ALL SCRIPTS TESTED IN WIN10, LINUX (DEBIAN-MATE) & MACOS-CATALINA, USING MPV v0.36 (INCL. v3) & v0.35. TESTED SMPLAYER RELEASES .7z .exe .dmg .AppImage .flatpak .snap  ALL SCRIPTS NOW PASS snap INSPECTION.
----"autoload.lua" NAME IS ALREADY TAKEN BY A PLAYLIST SCRIPT WHICH LOADS ALL VIDEO FILES IN FOLDER. autoloader MAY LOAD SCRIPTS ONLY.
----SMPLAYER ACTIONS  aspect_none reset_zoom  CAN START EACH FILE (ADVANCED PREFERENCES). IT MAY CONTROL FINAL GPU WINDOW. MOUSE WHEEL FUNCTION CAN BE SWITCHED FROM seek TO zoom. seeking WITH GRAPHS IS TOO SLOW, BUT zoom INSTANT. FINAL video-zoom CONTROLLED BY SMPLAYERâ†’GPU.
----EVEN WITH ALL SCRIPTS ACTIVE I CONSIDER PLAYBACK SMOOTHER THAN VLC, DEPENDING ON VIDEO. ~800MB RAM NEEDED. SMOOTH-CROPPING IS TOO HARD THOUGH (STRETCHING BLACK BARS HAPPENS TO BE BAD FOR THE CPU). VLC APPEARS TO CHOP HUMAN FACES & STEADY-CAM FOOTAGE.
----UNLIKE A PLUGIN THE ONLY BINARY IS MPV ITSELF, & SCRIPTS COMMAND IT. EACH SCRIPT PREPS & CONTROLS GRAPH/S OF ffmpeg-filters. MOVING MASK, SPECTRUM, audio RANDOMIZATION & CROPS ARE NOTHING BUT MPV COMMANDS. HOWEVER THE FEWER COMMANDS THE BETTER - ALMOST ALL TIME DEPENDENCE IS BAKED INTO GRAPH FILTERS. 
----MPV HAS LUA, LIKE HOW GIMP HAS SCM (SCHEME), NOTEPAD++ HAS SCINTILLA, SCIENCE HAS PYTHON/LATEX, MATH HAS OCTAVE/MATLAB, STATS HAS R, WEB HAS JAVASCRIPT/HTML, & WINDOWS HAS AUTOHOTKEY (AHK), ETC.  AHK CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING WITH A 1MB .exe, WITH 1 SECOND BUILD TIME.

----LINUX BUILDS ADD MORE VARIETY, DEPENDING ON deb, AppImage, flatpak, snap & rpm. SO video SCRIPTING FOR LINUX CAN BE TRICKY, BECAUSE IDEALLY SCRIPTS SHOULD WORK WITH ALL POSSIBLE BUILDS.
----sudo apt install smplayer flatpak mpv snapd      FOR RELEVANT LINUX INSTALLS. OFFLINE LINUX ALL-IN-ONE: SMPlayer-23.6.0-x86_64.AppImage
----https://smplayer.info/en/download-linux & https://apt.fruit.je/ubuntu/jammy/mpv/ FOR LINUX SMPLAYER & MPV.
----flatpak run info.smplayer.SMPlayer      snap run smplayer       FOR LINUX TESTING.
----sudo snap install *.snap  TO OFFLINE-INSTALL smplayer*.snap     BUT IT WON'T WORK WITH "~/", NOR SOME FILTERS THE EXACT SAME WAY, LIKE shuffleplanes,negate=y,scale=flags:eval. IT ALSO BLOCKS SYSTEM COMMANDS.
