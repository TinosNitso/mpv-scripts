CLOCK, MULTI-STEREO AUDIO-SPEED RANDOMIZATION ([aspeed](aspeed.lua)), MASK ANIME ([automask](automask.lua)), SPECTRUM ([autocomplex](autocomplex.lua)) & SMOOTH CROPPING ([autocrop](autocrop.lua)) FOR [SMPLAYER](https://smplayer.info) & [MPV](https://mpv.io)! 

EXAMPLE INSTALLATION: IN WINDOWS COPY/PASTE THESE .lua SCRIPTS INTO smplayer-portable FOLDER & ENTER 

`--script=autoloader.lua`

IN SMPLAYER ADVANCED PREFERENCES. IN LINUX & MACOS EXTRACT TO Desktop FOLDER mpv-scripts THEN ENTER

`--script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/autoloader.lua`

ALL FREE FOR WINDOWS, LINUX & MACOS. ðŸ™‚

THE SCRIPTS CAN BE OPENED & OPTIONS EDITED IN NOTEPAD (NO WORD WRAP). I USE [NOTEPAD++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) ON WINDOWS, & BRACKETS ON MACOS.

THE autocrop ABOVE IS BETTER THAN v1.2. THAT ONE HAS A FIDGET-TO-THE-RIGHT BUG BECAUSE I MISTOOK 1/a+1/b FOR 1/(a+b) WHEN LINEARIZING SOME INVERSE SCALES. THE NEWER ONE IS MUCH SMOOTHER & USES ONLY vf-command - NO GRAPH REPLACEMENTS. THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG WAS THE crop FILTER IS BUGGY, & THE SIMPLEST WORKAROUND IS NEGATIVE overlay. THE vf-command IS SUFFICIENT TO SPELL OUT A FULL PROGRESSION! ðŸ™‚

MP3 COVER ART STILL USING 3GB RAM FOR NO REASON (BUG).
