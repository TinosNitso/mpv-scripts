Video clock, multi-stereo audio-speed randomization ([aspeed](aspeed.lua)), animated mask generator ([automask](automask.lua)), dual animated spectrum ([autocomplex](autocomplex.lua)) & insta-cropping ([autocrop](autocrop.lua)) for [SMPlayer](https://smplayer.info) & [MPV](https://mpv.io)! Newest scripts in `mpv-scripts.zip` on GitHub. Toggle them by double-clicking on mute (m&m). Pictures, videos & audio can be drag & dropped onto SMPlayer, to light them up. The scripts can be opened & options edited in Notepad (no word wrap). [main](main.lua) has much more info, & options for which scripts & subtitles load, & ytdl. I use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) on Windows, & Brackets on MacOS. All free for Windows, Linux & MacOS. ðŸ™‚

To use on YouTube select Openâ†’URL in SMPlayer. Rumble, Odyssey & RedTube also compatible. Double-clicking mute makes the mask smoothly vanish or re-appear, along with black-bars (smooth padding), & the audio switches btwn randomized & normal. aspeed.lua options can activate chipmunk mode on left-channel (in sync), as well as tri-color clock! autocrop handles transparent input, too, along with a track-list with start & end times. MPV has instant zoom, but unfortunately no scroll bar (to pan around with mouse, etc). Keyboard shortcuts only work if MPV has its own window (SMPlayer preference).

See GitHub `doc` folder for pdf manuals.

## Installation
In Windows extract all `.lua` scripts from `.zip` & copy/paste them into `smplayer-portable` (or smplayer) folder. Then in SMPlayer Advanced Preferences enter 

`--script=.`

`.` is the directory containing `main.lua`. Then hit OK & play. Overall I consider playback smoother than VLC. [main](main.lua) is like a README (in LUA). 

In Linux & MacOS create folder `mpv-scripts` on Desktop. Then extract all scripts into it. For YouTube also extract [yt-dlp_linux](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) or *yt-dlp_macos* into the same folder. Then in SMPlayer enter

`--script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/`

`~/` means home folder. In Linux try `sudo apt install smplayer` or double-click the `.AppImage`. All scripts also compatible with `.snap` & `.flatpak` releases.

## Safety Inspection
Before running scripts it's safer to first check them in Notepad++. Search for & highlight `os.execute` (operating system), `io.popen` (input output process) & `mp.command*` (media player). Safe commands include `expand-path` `frame-step` `seek` `playlist-next` `playlist-play-index` `stop` `quit` `af*` `vf*`, but `load-script` `run` `subprocess*` may be unsafe. `set*` & `change-list` are safe except for `script-opts` which may hook an unsafe executable. To inspect a script check potentially unsafe commands. Ignore all comments (anything following `--`). 

## Terminal Commands
To run in Windows from Command Prompt, create a New Text Document in SMPlayer folder & rename it `TEST.CMD`. Also copy in `TEST.MP4`. Then right-click on `TEST.CMD` & click `Edit`. In Notepad copy/paste:

`CMD /K MPV\MPV --script=. *.MP4`

Then Save it & double-click it. The command line shows warnings, etc. MPV pauses when text in CMD is selected. All these scripts can be individually run via CMD, PowerShell, zsh, sh, etc. They only deliver scripted commands to MPV. But most ppl prefer an interface like SMPlayer.

In MacOS go to *Launchpad*â†’*Other*â†’*Terminal*. Then the exact `zsh` command is:

`/Applications/SMPlayer.app/Contents/MacOS/mpv --script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/ "https://youtu.be/5qm8PH4xAss"`

That uses the MPV bundled with SMPlayer. In Linux the exact command to load YouTube from terminal is:

`mpv --script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/ "https://youtu.be/5qm8PH4xAss"`

MacOS users can also drag & drop `mpv.app` onto Applications. Then the zsh command is:

`/Applications/mpv.app/Contents/MacOS/mpv --script=~/Desktop/mpv-scripts/ "https://youtu.be/5qm8PH4xAss"` 

## Versions

MPV v0.38.0, v0.37.0, v0.36.0 & v0.35.1 fully supported. v0.37+ preferred. mpv.exe can be [replaced](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/release/), within smplayer-portable. New MacOS builds are [here](https://laboratory.stolendata.net/~djinn/mpv_osx/).

SMPlayer v24.5.0 supported. v23.12 has an annoying pause issue: `no-osd seek 0 relative exact` accompanying every `set pause yes`. Releases tested include .7z .exe .app .AppImage .flatpak & .snap.

FFmpeg versions v6.1 (.deb), v6.0 (.exe .flatpak), v5.1.3, v5.1.2 (.app), v4.4.2 (.snap) & v4.3.2 (.AppImage) supported.

## Latest Updates
Newest scripts above in `mpv-scripts.zip` aren't properly released yet. Coding style improved but another JPEG seek bugfix & Linux testing is needed for next release.
- automask: Colors bugfix. Latest release failed at this. But now CPU consumption is higher!  Also the mask fades in at @playback-restart. `o.mask_no_vid` bugfix, & `convolution` can sharpen with variable percentage.
- main.lua: Proper expansion of `o.title`. Added `o.options_delay`.  Improved codes for all scripts.
- aspeed: Improved AbDay centering. ' '=64%'ã€€' not 60%.  Removed `start_file()`.
- autocrop: Replaced `o.msg_log` with `o.msg_level`. Improved performance on MacOS (old FFmpeg). JPEG seek bugfix (MPV can crash Windows if it doesn't reset STARTPTS).
- Image (PNG) transparency for autocomplex & automask.
- `property_handler()` for all scripts, except main.lua.
